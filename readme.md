# Java Swing Calculator

## Overview
This project is a simple Calculator application implemented using Java Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI). The calculator provides basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Clear Functionality**: Clear the current input.
- **Decimal Support**: Input decimal numbers for precise calculations.
- **Keyboard Support**: Perform calculations using the keyboard.

## Technologies Used
- **Java Swing**: GUI toolkit for Java applications.
- **MVC Architecture**: Model-View-Controller pattern for organizing code and separating concerns.
- **Event Handling**: Handling user interactions and events in the GUI.
- **Layout Management**: Organizing components within the GUI interface.

## Structure
The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture:
1. **Model**: Represents the data and business logic of the calculator.
2. **View**: User interface components including buttons, text fields, etc.
3. **Controller**: Handles user inputs and updates the model accordingly.

## Usage
To run the Calculator application, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the Java files.
3. Run the `CalculatorApp` class.

## Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Number Keys (0-9)**: Input numbers.
- **Arithmetic Operators (+, -, *, /)**: Perform arithmetic operations.
- **Enter/Return Key**: Perform calculation.
- **Escape Key**: Clear the current input.

## Testing
Testing of the Calculator application can be performed by manually testing each arithmetic operation and ensuring correct results are displayed.

## Future Enhancements
Future enhancements to the Calculator application may include:
- Scientific functions (trigonometric, logarithmic, etc.).
- Memory functionality (store, recall, clear memory).
- Theme customization options for the GUI.
- Support for more complex expressions and calculations.
