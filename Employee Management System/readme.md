- **Main Dashboard**: Upon successful login, users are directed to the main dashboard where various operations can be performed.
- **Add Employee**: Allows users to add a new employee to the system by entering necessary details.
- **Remove Employee**: Enables users to delete employee information by providing the employee ID.
- **View and Update Employee**: Users can view and update employee information by entering the employee ID.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core programming language used for system development.
- **Swing**: Java GUI toolkit utilized for creating the graphical user interface.
- **SQL**: Structured Query Language used for managing data in the relational database.
